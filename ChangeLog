Summary of changes from v0.03 to v0.04 (2012-01-06)
===================================================

	* Fixed a bug which would record incorrect count amounts for the
	v2-Protocol of the Gamma Scout for counts >2^11 per interval (thanks go to
	Benjamin Knispel for the bug report and provided test data)
	* Included a script "fix_counts_v0.03.py" which fixes incorrectly recorded
	count data
	* The v1 and v2 protocol have nothing to do with the Basic/Alert variant
	of the counter. Renamed everything and changed command line parameters to
	do the right thing (also thanks to Benjamin Knispel for reporting this).
	* Synchronizing time to Gamma Scout is now possible in UTC ("syncutctime"
	command)
	* SQLite output backend added a metadata table which contains version
	information (in case this shall be automatically upgraded in the future)
	* Fixed a hang for v2 protocol that would occur if no Gamma Scout was
	connected to the PC
