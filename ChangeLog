Summary of changes from v0.04 to v0.05 (2013-xx-xx)
===================================================

	* Major refactoring of communication infrastructure code, protocol
	handlers, command parsing and execution in order to allow simulation of
	Gamma Scouts without having devices to test (important for dev) and for
	easier integration of new devices (e.g. Gamma Scout Online)
	* Simulation tool to emulate Gamma Scout on a Unix socket for testing and
	refactoring of code without access to a real device
	* Support of the Gamma Scout Online
	* Conversion of CPS to uSv according to official calibration ("Toolbox") curves
	* Inclusion of version within help
	* Binary output file format modified, added capability of reading back
	binary dumps
	* Added capability to only switch Gamma Scout mode without performing any
	other actions
	* Filenames now support strftime substitutions
	* SQL output backend support
	* Text file output is now always UTF-8, console output is tried as the
	local encoding (and fallback to ASCII used if this doesn't work out).
	Fixes a bug where GSU would terminate if an ASCII locale was selected
	* MySQL backend included (using PyMySQL); still somewhat experimental (the
	available Python binding libraries for MySQL/Py3k are rather crappy at the
	moment)
	* GammaPlot now included for plotting recorded database data using
	Matplotlib
	* Bugfix in TXT output backend (CPS and CPM are swithced)
	* Bugfix when count values overflow (thanks to Erik Berglund for reporting
	this)


Summary of changes from v0.03 to v0.04 (2012-01-06)
===================================================

	* Fixed a bug which would record incorrect count amounts for the
	v2-Protocol of the Gamma Scout for counts >2^11 per interval (thanks go to
	Benjamin Knispel for the bug report and provided test data)
	* Included a script "fix_counts_v0.03.py" which fixes incorrectly recorded
	count data
	* The v1 and v2 protocol have nothing to do with the Basic/Alert variant
	of the counter. Renamed everything and changed command line parameters to
	do the right thing (also thanks to Benjamin Knispel for reporting this).
	* Synchronizing time to Gamma Scout is now possible in UTC ("syncutctime"
	command)
	* SQLite output backend added a metadata table which contains version
	information (in case this shall be automatically upgraded in the future)
	* Fixed a hang for v2 protocol that would occur if no Gamma Scout was
	connected to the PC

Summary of changes from v0.03-RC3 to v0.03 (2011-10-26)
=======================================================

	* Changed error messages a little bit

Summary of changes from v0.03-RC2 to v0.03-RC3 (2011-10-23)
===========================================================

	* No file is generated when device does not support reading the
	configuration blob
	* Time in log now not time_t, but realtive to first message and relative
	to last message
	* Increased timeout for Gamma Scout Basic log reading even further

Summary of changes from v0.03-RC1 to v0.03-RC2 (2011-10-23)
===========================================================

	* Bugfixes in some Gamma Scout Basic response strings (missing spaces at
	the end of settime/setdate responses)
	* Increased timeout for log reading on Gamma Scout Basic
	* Proper error messages when device times out

Summary of changes from v0.02 to v0.03-RC1 (2011-10-14)
=======================================================

	* Added support for "Gamma Scout Basic" (aka "Gamma Scout without Alert")
	* Added very simple simulation data feature for Gamma Scout Basic (data
	kindly provided by Jörg Wartenberg)
	* Added XML export functionality

Summary of features of v0.02 (2011-10-02)
=========================================

	* Support of Gamma Scout W/Alert via USB (FTDI RS232 converter)
	* Export of data in sqlite, txt, csv or binary format possible
